Chapter 1 – Introduction
1.1 Introduction to the Thesis
In recent years, the interest in financial markets has increased significantly among individual
investors. Especially in developing economies like Turkey, the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) 100 index
represents a critical benchmark for evaluating company performances and economic trends.
Investors face the challenge of making informed decisions in a volatile and information-heavy
environment. One of the key issues is understanding the risk and return dynamics of various
sectors and companies, which requires complex analysis and experience.
This thesis addresses this problem by proposing a data-driven clustering model that classifies
BIST 100 companies based on their financial performance indicators. The model aims to group
companies into similar risk-return profiles using unsupervised learning algorithms. Furthermore,
an interactive web application will be developed to guide investors in choosing appropriate
company groups based on their personal risk preferences. By combining machine learning and
financial analytics, the study provides a practical tool for investment decision support.
1.2 Purpose of the Study
The main goal of this thesis is to develop a machine learning-based clustering model that
classifies BIST 100 companies according to key financial indicators such as volatility, return,
beta, trading volume, and sector. After identifying meaningful clusters, the system will offer
investment suggestions based on the user's selected risk profile. This approach aims to support
individual investors in their decision-making process by providing data-backed, easy-tounderstand insights.
1.3 Scope of the Study
This study focuses on companies listed in the BIST 100 index. Only publicly available financial
indicators such as historical stock returns, volatility, beta coefficients, P/E ratios, market
capitalization, and sector information will be used for analysis. The project excludes
macroeconomic indicators, real-time data processing, and external events (e.g., political changes,
breaking news).
The machine learning part of the study will focus on unsupervised clustering techniques such as
K-means, supported by dimensionality reduction methods like PCA. The web application will be
developed using Flask to provide a comprehensive interactive investment suggestion tool with user authentication and personalized dashboards. Deep learning
2
models, portfolio optimization algorithms, or transaction-level simulations are beyond the scope
due to time and complexity constraints.
1.4 Research Methodology
The study will be conducted in the following stages:
• Data Collection & Preprocessing: Financial data of BIST 100 companies will be collected
from sources such as Yahoo Finance or KAP. Cleaning and normalization steps will be
applied.
• Feature Engineering: Key financial metrics like average return, standard deviation
(volatility), beta, and volume will be calculated.
• Clustering Analysis: Unsupervised learning algorithms like K-means and DBSCAN will
be applied to group companies into clusters based on similar financial behavior.
• Visualization & Interpretation: Clusters will be visualized and interpreted in terms of
investment risk and sector distribution.
• Web Application Development: A Flask-based web application will be developed with user authentication, personalized dashboards, and interactive data visualizations. Users will be able to select a risk profile and receive matching cluster suggestions, along with summary statistics and company lists.
